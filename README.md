# Tower-Defence-Game

# Software Development - Tower Defence Project
We will implement a Tower Defence Game. It will have "towers" that basically defends against enemies trying to get to the end of the map or stage. We will have different towers and enemies and have some sort of upgrade/ progression system.

# Plan
We will start by first developing a normal "testing world" with very simple models where we can test the different towers and develop them.  
We will also have a group working on the normal maps that we will play on later. This will Be making smooth walking for the enemies aswell as creating and building the actual playable map.  
We will do the project in c# and Unity game engine as our build system.
